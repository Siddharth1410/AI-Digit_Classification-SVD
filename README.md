# AI-Digit_Classification-SVD
0-9 digit classification for Artificial Intelligence using SVD

## An SVD basis classification algorithm
### Training.
#### digitsTrainCombined.csv –
this is a 256 × 4000 matrix. Each column represents a 16 × 16 grayscale image of a digit. The first 400 columns are examples of zeros, the
next 400 columns are examples of ones, and so forth, with the last 400 columns being
examples of nines.

### Classification.
#### digitsTestCombined.csv – this is a 256×1000 matrix. Each column represents a 16×16
grayscale image of a digit. The first 100 columns are examples of zeros, the next 100
columns are examples of ones, and so forth, with the last 100 columns being examples
of nines.
